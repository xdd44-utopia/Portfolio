            The examples from various visual artists in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/tech/time-warp-architecture-seven-iconic-buildings-reimagined-ncsl871061" target="_blank">this website</a> perfectly interpret the meaning of "transferring architectural
            styles", which I would like to automate with deep learning technologies.

        <h2>Current progress:</h2>
        <p>
            Now I'm focusing on how to define and achieve "transferring" for architectural styles. It's a hard problem since such styles are defined by both material textures and structural features in various scales.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've made some tests on several existing models, including painting style transfer with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16877" target="_blank">Artflow</a>, Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004"
                target="_blank">Pix2pix</a> to examine the possibilities of different approaches. The images below are examples showing corresponding challenges.
        </p>

            </div>
            <div class="landscapedsc">
                <p>This example by Artflow + WCT shows that popular style transfer models may not be suitable with this task as only the color and a small trace of texture from the style image (left) are being transferred (bottom right) on to the content
                    image (top right).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="landscapedsc">
                <p>This example by Pix2pix and <a href="https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/" target="_blank">CMP facade labeling</a> (top right) creates unrecognizable images (bottom right) because of the large difference in appearance of windows between
                    sample buildings in databese (left) and input house (top right, the same as previous house).</p>
            </div>

                <p>This example video from using Pix2pix trained with 450 depth images generated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00569" target="_blank">DiverseDepth</a> is currently the best one, the smoothness of which is already impressive. However,
                    there're still significant glitches and unusual movements. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Obviously, increasing the size of training set helps improve the result. The results below come from a model trained from 1444 photos of modernist and postmodernist buildings. However, it can be noticed that the results still more or less failed to preserve
            the original 3D primitive shapes and the facades are flat.

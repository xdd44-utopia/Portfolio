                <p id="name"><b>&quot;xdd44&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;Chenyue&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo&nbsp;</b></p>
                <p>&quot;xdd44&quot; is a programmer, photographer, and artistic designer. As a <a href="https://architecture.mit.edu/people/xdd44" target="_blank">Master of Architecture student at MIT</a>, he investigates visual spatial transformations that bridge the physical and digital realms, with a deep passion for photography and digital imagery. He also explores interactive systems and computational geometry across various media, with a strong belief that computational techniques can enhance creativity and push the boundaries of artistic and design practices.
                    Xdd has research and working experience at CityU ERFI Lab and Foster + Partners, and currently serves as research assistant at Media Lab’s Critical Matter group. Before coming to MIT, he earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong, where he won multiple medals as a member of the university’s programming contest team.

                <p id="name"><b>What is &quot;xdd44&quot; and why?</b></p>
                <p>&quot;xdd44&quot; is my preferred name in real life (you can just call me "xdd"), my usual username on internet, and my nametag when playing video games. It is the intials of a Chinese nickname that is too naive to explain here. (&quot;Chenyue&quot; is my legal first name, &quot;Leo&quot; is an English name my parents gave me and I used it during my undergrad.)</p>
                <p>I like and prefer to use &quot;xdd44&quot; even at school because I've always been drawn to the virtual society of the internet. In that world, everyone is treated equally, regardless of race, gender, or nationality. Nametags don't carry social markers that lead to assumptions or stereotypes. In online gaming communities, poeple compete based purely on skill and are remembered by nametags. I hope to be treated the same way in real life: when people see my name, I want them to focus not on the fact that I'm Chinese or male implied by &quot;Chenyue&quot; or &quot;Leo&quot;, but on what I've achieved - as a programmer, as a photographer, as a designer, and as &quot;xdd44&quot;.</p>
